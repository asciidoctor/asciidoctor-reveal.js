= Write Your Presentation

Let's see some examples of `revealjs` backend features.
Additional examples can be found in the AsciiDoc files (.adoc) in `examples/`.

== Basic presentation with speaker notes

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Title Slide

== Slide One

* Foo
* Bar
* World

== Slide Two

A Great Story

[.notes]
--
* tell anecdote
* make a point
--
----

In previous snippet we are creating a slide titled Slide One with bullets and another one titled Slide Two with centered text (reveal.js`' default behavior) with link:{url-revealjs-doc}#speaker-notes[speaker notes].
Other syntax exists to create speaker notes, see `examples/speaker-notes.adoc`.

Starting with reveal.js 3.5 speaker notes supports configurable layouts:

Speaker notes are opened by pressing `s`.
With reveal.js 3.5 they require a webserver to work.
This limitation is not present in 3.6.
You can get a Web server running quickly with:

 $ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000 -b 127.0.0.1

Then use your browser to navigate to the URL \http://localhost:5000.

== Slides without titles

There are a few ways to have no titles on slides.

* Setting your title to `!`
* Adding the `notitle` option to your slide
* Adding the `conceal` option to your slide

See {url-project-repo}/blob/master/examples/concealed-slide-titles.adoc[concealed-slide-titles.adoc].

NOTE: `conceal` and `notitle` have the advantage that the slide still has an ID so it can be linked to.

IMPORTANT: Like the first page of an AsciiDoc document, the first slide is handled differently.
To hide the whole slide use the `:notitle:` xref:asciidoc:document:header-ref.adoc[document attribute].
To achieve the effect of hiding only the first slide's title, combine the `:notitle:` attribute on the first slide and use `[%notitle]` on the second slide which will, in effect, be your first slide now.

== Content meant for multiple converters

Some content can be created with both slides and book in mind.

To mark slides split points you can use preprocessor conditionals combined
with a backend declaration.
Breaking points are set using slides with no title `=== !` wrapped in a
conditional: `ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]`.
In the end, the whole document has to be compiled with the backend option:
`-b revealjs`

For example:

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Main section

=== Sub Section

Small +
Multiline +
intro

. very
. long
. list
. of
. items

\ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

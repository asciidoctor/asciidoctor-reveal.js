= Steps

Steps are used to highlight or incrementally reveal individual elements on a slide. +
This is what _reveal.js_ calls {url-revealjs-home}/fragments[fragments].
Every element with the role `fragment` will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you can use the role _fragment_ on any elements,
we recommend to use the _step_ option to declare a fragment (see below). +
It will ensure better portability and avoid CSS conflicts when using another converter.
====

== Step option

Let's assume you have an unordered list on one of your slides and you want to reveal the items one-by-one.
Declare the `step` option on the list as follows:

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Topic

[%step]
* this
* is
* revealed
* gradually
----

NOTE: At the moment, only `fade-in` style is supported for lists.

=== Step style

The default step style is to start out invisible and fade in.
This style can be changed by using a different role on the block or inline element.

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Topic

[.highlight-blue%step]
blue

[%step]
white

[.highlight-red%step]
red
----

Here's the complete list of the built-in styles:

[cols="2m,3",opts=header]
|====
|Name
|Effect

|fade-out
|Start visible, fade out

|fade-up
|Slide up while fading in

|fade-down
|Slide down while fading in

|fade-left
|Slide left while fading in

|fade-right
|Slide right while fading in

|fade-in-then-out
|Fades in, then out on the next step

|fade-in-then-semi-out
|Fades in, then to 50% on the next step

|grow
|Scale up

|shrink
|Scale down

|strike
|Strike through

|highlight-red
|Turn text red

|highlight-green
|Turn text green

|highlight-blue
|Turn text blue

|highlight-current-red
|Turn text red, then back to original on next step

|highlight-current-green
|Turn text green, then back to original on next step

|highlight-current-blue
|Turn text blue, then back to original on next step
|====

=== Step order

By default fragments will be stepped through in the order that they appear in the document.
This display order can be changed using the `step` attribute.

[source, asciidoc]

== Topic

[TIP,step=3]
Finally, a pro tip...

[WARNING,step=1]
First, watch out for...

[IMPORTANT.fade-up,step=2]
Second, don't forget...
----

NOTE: Multiple elements can appear at the same index.

== Text and inline elements

Since it's not possible to define attributes or options on text and inline elements, you can use the role _step_.

[source, asciidoc]
----
The [.step.highlight-red]#greatest glory in living# lies not in never falling, but in [.step.highlight-red]#rising every time we fall#.
----

In the above example, we will highlight in red "greatest glory in living" and then "rising every time we fall".

== Limitations and workarounds

=== Description lists

Currently, the `%step` option and the `step` attribute are not supported on description lists.
The following will _not_ work:

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Topic

[%step]
Hard drive:: Permanent storage for operating system and/or user files.
RAM:: Temporarily stores information the CPU uses during operation.
----

=== Show list items all at once

If you want to reveal list items all at once (i.e., you don't want to reveal the list items one-by-one),
you can wrap a list block in an open block:

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Topic

[%step]
--
.Greek Alphabet
* α
* β
* γ
--
----

In the above example, the title "Greek Alphabet" and all the list items will be revealed at once.

And here's another example where we apply the _step_ option on different elements:

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Topic

[%step]
--
.First
* a
* b
* c
--

[%step]
--
.Second
[%step]
* d
* e
* f
--
----

Here's what will happen step by step:

. the title "First" and all the list items will be revealed at once
. The title "Second" will be revealed
. The list items on the "Second" list will be revealed one-by-one

= Auto Animate

This feature is a wrapper of https://revealjs.com/auto-animate/[reveal.js auto-animate feature].

Since your AsciiDoc file will be transformed into an HTML 5 presentation,
You can define Asciidoctor attributes and options to configure the reveal.js auto-animate feature.
Under the hood, these settings will be mapped to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*[custom HTML data attributes].

For boolean attributes which means `true` if you set it, or `false` if you omit it,
you should use Asciidoctor options, such as: `%auto-animate`.

For reveal.js settings which need to set specific values, you can use Asciidoctor attributes,
such as: `auto-animate-easing=ease-in-out`.

== Enable auto-animate

To enable the reveal.js auto-animate feature, you can add the `%auto-animate` option on adjacent elements.

In the following example, we are using the `%auto-animate` option on two adjacent sections:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate]
== !

Matched element will be animated automatically!

[%auto-animate]
== !

[.highlight]
Matched element will be animated automatically!

And move to the right position!

== Source blocks

Here's a complete example:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=planets]
----
let planets = [
  { name: 'mars', diameter: 6779 },
]
----

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=planets]
----
let planets = [
  { name: 'mars', diameter: 6779 },
  { name: 'earth', diameter: 12742 },
  { name: 'jupiter', diameter: 139820 }
]
----

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=planets]
----
let circumferenceReducer = ( c, planet ) => {
  return c + planet.diameter * Math.PI;
}

let planets = [
  { name: 'mars', diameter: 6779 },
  { name: 'earth', diameter: 12742 },
  { name: 'jupiter', diameter: 139820 }
]

let c = planets.reduce( circumferenceReducer, 0 )

== Control unmatched element animation

By default, no matching element will fade in.
You can make them appear instantly using `auto-animate-unmatched=false`.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate,auto-animate-unmatched=false]
== Unmatched

Introduction. (matched)

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-unmatched=false]
== Unmatched

Introduction. (matched)

This will be shown instantly ⚡ (unmatched)
----

== Set animation duration

You can set the `auto-animate-duration` attribute to control the animation duration:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate,auto-animate-duration=5]
== Duration

This animation...

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-duration=5]
== Duration

This animation...

...will take 5 seconds! ⌚
----

== Animation group

You can separate groups of auto-animated slides, which will distinct from each other by using the `auto-animate-id` attribute.
Auto animation occurs in adjacent slides of the same group or both don't have one.

The `%auto-animate-restart` option will prevent auto-animate between the previous slide (even if they have the same id).

The example below illustrates `auto-animate-restart` usage:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate]
== !

First Item

[%auto-animate]
== !

First Item

Second Item

[%auto-animate%auto-animate-restart]
== !

First Item

Second Item

Third Item (restart)

[%auto-animate]
== !

First Item

Second Item

Third Item (restart)

Fourth Item
----

== Set animation easing function

The Asciidoctor attribute `auto-animate-easing` is used to control the speed of the transition.
You can use any value supported by https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function[transition-timing-function].

Here's an example using the value `ease-in-out`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

Pong! 🏓

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

Pong! 🏓

🏓 Ping?

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

Pong! 🏓

= Title Slide

The title slide is where customization for the generated presentation can be configured via AsciiDoc xref:asciidoc:attributes:document-attributes.adoc[document attributes].
These are the document-scope variables assigned at the top of a document, as part of the document header as xref:asciidoc:attributes:attribute-entries.adoc[attribute entries].

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Title Slide
:revealjs_theme: sky
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Slide One

* Foo
* Bar
* World
----

In AsciiDoc terms, the first line is the document title and the variable definitions following it are part of the xref:asciidoc:document:header.adoc[document header].

NOTE: Starting your document with a section title means AsciiDoc interprets your document header as empty.

Any variables set will not be picked up by the converter and will not influence the resulting presentation.
The next example shows this mistake:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== This is not a document title
// These settings are not interpreted as document attributes and will not be accessible to
// the asciidoctor-revealjs converter.
:revealjs_theme: sky
:source-highlighter: highlight.js
----

NOTE: Even if you start a document with a level-1 section, you can still have a document header.
The variables then need to be defined _above_ the section header.
Another way to think of this is having a document header without a document title.

== Customizing the Title Slide

In addition to configuring document-wide settings, the title slide can also define visual customization that is only applied to the title slide.

This converter supports changing the color, image, video, iframe and transitions of the title slide.

Read {url-revealjs-doc}#slide-backgrounds[the reveal.js documentation] to understand what attributes can be set.
Keep in mind that for a title slide, you must replace `data-` with `title-slide-` in the name of the attribute.

See link:{url-project-examples}/title-slide-image.adoc[title-slide-image.adoc] for an example of using these attributes.

The title slide also given an special `title` CSS class to help with template customization.

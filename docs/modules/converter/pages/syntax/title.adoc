= Title Slide Customization
:navtitle: Title Slide

The title slide is customized via AsciiDoc attributes.
These are the global variable assigned at the top of a document under the lead
title that look like this: `:name: value`.

This converter supports changing the color, image, video, iframe and
transitions of the title slide.

Read link:{url-revealjs-doc}#slide-backgrounds[the relevant reveal.js documentation] to understand what attributes need to be set.
Keep in mind that for title slides you must replace `data-` with `title-slide-`.

See link:{url-project-examples}/title-slide-image.adoc[title-slide-image.adoc].

The title slide is also added a `title` CSS class to help with template customization.

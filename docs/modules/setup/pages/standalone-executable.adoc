= Standalone Executable

Pre-built binary packages can be downloaded from our {url-project-repo}/releases[GitHub release page].
We provide them for Windows 64-bit, Linux 64-bit and macOS 64-bit (x86-64).
Open an issue if your platform isn't supported.
The executables are built using the xref:node-js-setup.adoc[Node.js / JavaScript] toolchain.

== Install

* {url-project-repo}/releases[Download the executable] for your platform and make it executable with `chmod` or using the files properties' user interface.
* Copy or clone the reveal.js presentation framework in the directory where you will build your slidedeck.
Here we do a shallow clone of the repo:

  $ git clone -b 3.9.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git

== Convert AsciiDoc into slides

Open a terminal where the executable is and type:

 $ ./asciidoctor-revealjs --version

The command should report the Asciidoctor reveal.js and Asciidoctor CLI version in the terminal:

[source,console]
----
Asciidoctor reveal.js 3.0.1 using Asciidoctor.js 2.0.3 (Asciidoctor 2.0.9) [https://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (node v12.13.1 on linux)
CLI version 3.1.0
----

If you don't have an existing presentation, you can create a sample presentation named [.path]_presentation.adoc_:

.presentation.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Title Slide
:revealjsdir: reveal.js

== Slide One

* Foo
* Bar
* World
----

To convert the sample presentation into slides, open a terminal and type:

 $ ./asciidoctor-revealjs presentation.adoc

The above command will generate a file named [.path]_presentation.html_.
You can open this file in a browser.

= Ruby Setup
:navtitle: Ruby

NOTE: To ensure repeatability, we recommend that you manage your presentation projects using {url-bundler}[Bundler^].

== Prerequisites

. Install {url-bundler}[Bundler^] (if not already installed) using your system's package manager or with:

  $ gem install bundler

. If you're using RVM, make sure you switch away from any gemset:

  $ rvm use default
+
or
+
  $ rvm use system

== Install

NOTE: These instructions should be repeated for every presentation project.

. Create project directory

  $ mkdir my-awesome-presentation
  $ cd my-awesome-presentation

. Create a file named `Gemfile` with the following content:
+
[source,ruby]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'asciidoctor-revealjs' # latest released version
----
+
NOTE: For some reason, when you use the system Ruby on Fedora, you also have to add the `json` gem to the Gemfile.
+
. Install the gems into the project

  $ bundle config --local github.https true
  $ bundle --path=.bundle/gems --binstubs=.bundle/.bin

. Optional: Copy or clone reveal.js presentation framework.
Allows you to modify themes or view slides offline.

  $ git clone -b 4.1.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git

== Rendering the AsciiDoc into slides

. Create content in a file (*.adoc, *.ad, etc.).
See examples on the xref:converter:features.adoc[Features page] to get started.

. Generate HTML presentation from the AsciiDoc source

  $ bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs \
    -a revealjsdir=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js@4.1.2 CONTENT_FILE.adoc

. If you did the optional step of having a local reveal.js clone you can
convert AsciiDoc source with

  $ bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs CONTENT_FILE.adoc

TIP: If you are using {url-gh-pages}[GitHub Pages^], plan ahead by keeping your source files on `master` branch and all output files on the `gh-pages` branch.

== Features unique to the Ruby CLI

Starting with 4.0.0 you can specify a set of custom templates to use instead of the ones provided by this project.
This can help you achieve even more concise AsciiDoc syntax and integration with reveal.js at the cost of more maintenance.

To use it, add the following dependencies to your `Gemfile`:

  gem 'tilt', '~>2.0'
  gem 'slim', '~>4.0'

Then install the dependencies with:

  $ bundle install

The feature is activated with the `--template-dir` or `-T` option:

  $ bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs -T templates/ CONTENT_FILE.adoc

Any individual template file not provided in the directory specified on the command-line will fall back to the template provided by your version of Asciidoctor reveal.js.
Refer to our {url-project-templates}[templates^] for inspiration.

This feature hasn't been ported to the JavaScript CLI (and API) or the standalone executables.

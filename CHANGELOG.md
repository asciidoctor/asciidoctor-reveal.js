## 4.1.0 (2020-12-19)

### Upgrade considerations

  * When a `background-video` attribute points to a file, that file is now looked up relative to the `imagesdir` document attribute.
    This new behavior aligns with what images and video macros already did.
    Existing slide decks using both `imagesdir` and `background-video` will need to move some files around.
    See [#356](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/356) for details.

### Enhancements

  * Introduced a `step` attribute to control the display order of elements

    For instance: `icon:font-awesome-flag[set=fab]` ([#393](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/393))
  * Upgraded Font Awesome to 5.15.1
  * Introduced an attribute to configure Font Awesome version `font-awesome-version` ([#392](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/392))
  * Added support for data attributes using AsciiDoc attributes prefixed by `data-` ([#241](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/241))
  * Added text alignment options to our _columns layout_ feature: `has-text-left`, `has-text-right` and `has-text-justified`.
    See [#354](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/354) for details.
  * Added a `mathjaxdir` attribute to control where MathJax is loaded from ([#350](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/350))

    [#355](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/355),
    [#361](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/361))

  * `autoslide` attribute is now supported at the slide level (
    [#367](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/367),
    [#368](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/368))
  * Implemented the `muted` option for the video macro for YouTube and Vimeo ([#358](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/358))

## 4.0.1 (2020-02-18)

Repackage for NPM.


## 4.0.0 (2020-02-18)

A major release with a ton of improvements!
All of reveal.js 3.8.0-3.9.2 new features are supported.
Added a new set of column layout options for quick slides design.
Highlight.js support improved.
Easier templates customizations.
New Java / JVM toolchain via [AsciidoctorJ-reveal.js](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj-reveal.js).
Support was added for Asciidoctor `docinfo` and `sectnums` attributes, `kbd` macro and callout styles were fixed.

See the *upgrade considerations* section for the list of potentially breaking changes.

### Upgrade considerations

  * Due to an upstream change in reveal.js 3.8.0, this back-end no longer supports earlier reveal.js versions.
    We added a compatibility matrix with reveal.js at the end of the README.
    See [#301](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/301) for details.
  * Using the attribute `background-opacity` to alter the opacity of the title slide no longer works.
    When the opacity feature was introduced we forgot to align with the other title slide attributes.
    The feature was introduced in 3.0.0 and the bug stayed in 3.1.0.
    Starting with 4.0.0 use `title-slide-background-opacity` instead.
    See issue [#323](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/323) for details.
  * The new _Columns layout_ feature required a new `<div>` that wraps all slide content (everything except the slide title).
    This might impact custom CSS with strict child relationships.
    See issue [#326](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/326) and PR [#332](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/332) for details.
  * We bundle Highlight.js instead of relying on reveal.js.
    We reduced the core set of supported languages and added the `highlightjs-languages` attribute to add specific languages on demand.
    Depending on what type of code you were highlighting, you might need to add your language using that attribute.
    See [#320](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/320) for details.
  * Our support of AsciiDoc `docinfo` attribute changed.
    We were previously injecting `docinfo-header.html` somewhere in the HTML `<head>`.
    Now, `docinfo-revealjs.html` goes last into the HTML `<head>`, `docinfo-header-revealjs.html` goes right before the first slide `<section>` and `docinfo-footer-revealjs.html` goes right after the last slide `<section>`.
    The new documentation is available [here](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js#supplemental-content-with-docinfo)
    and the related tickets are [#198](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/198)
    and [#324](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/324).
  * Default highlight.js theme is monokai. This follows a reveal.js change.

### Enhancements

  * New _Columns layout_ feature which provides easy to use roles to create multiple columns in slides.
    See the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js#columns-layout[feature's documentation] for usage details.
    See issue [#326](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/326) and PRs [#332](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/332), [#340](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/340) for details.
  * Built-in slim templates can now be overridden with `--template-dir` or `-T` when using the Ruby command-line interface ([#177](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/177), [#318](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/318), [#349](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/349))
  * Highlight.js is now bundled by us instead of reveal.js.
    You can add other languages not supported in the core set by using the `highlightjs-languages` attribute.
    It can also be loaded locally or from a CDN of your choice.
    See issues [#21](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/21), [#319](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/319) and [#320](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/320) for details.
  * We now support the Java / JVM ecosystem.
    This packaging happens in a separate project: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj-reveal.js[AsciidoctorJ reveal.js].
    See issue [#217](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/271) and PR [#337](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/337) for details.
  * Many new examples demonstrating various features
  * Documentation improvements ([#322](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/322))
  * Refactoring ([#327](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/327), [#330](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/330), [#333](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/333))

### Compliance

  * New reveal.js 3.8.0 and 3.9.0 features supported ([#301](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/301))
  ** Line numbers on source code blocks using Asciidoctor's `linenums` attribute

  * Added support for the `sectnums` AsciiDoc attribute ([#185](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/185), [#317](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/317))
  * Aligned our `docinfo` support to Asciidoctor Bespoke ([#198](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/198), [#324](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/324))
  * Support the `highlightjs-languages` attribute from Asciidocotor ([#319](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/319), [#320](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/320))
  * `background-opacity` title slide attribute renamed to `title-slide-background-opacity` ([#323](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/323), [#325](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/325))
  * Added support for the `kdb` macro to represent keyboard shortcuts ([#276](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/276), [#329](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/329))
  * Cosmetic improvements to callout lists ([#335](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/335))

  * Interactive debugging works again ([#322](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/322))
  * Fixed _Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined_ by dropping outdated documentation ([#344](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/344))

## 3.0.0 (2020-01-07)

An API breaking release for Asciidoctor.js users that brings a bright future of long term stability.
New Reveal.js features supported: background opacity, background positions, and PDF export.
AsciiDoc table options now supported.
A big FontAwesome update.
Many other little improvements and polish.

Special heads-up: we are already planning for another major release since Reveal.js 3.8 support will be considered a breaking change.
They changed how it is loaded and requires a template change incompatible with Reveal.js 3.1-3.7.

### Upgrade considerations

  * Node.js packaging changes!
    With the arrival of Asciidoctor.js 2.0.0 you can now use a command line interface (CLI) just like with Asciidoctor Ruby:

        $(npm bin)/asciidoctor -r @asciidoctor/reveal.js -b revealjs presentation.adoc

    If you want to keep generating your reveal.js presentations using the Node.js API,
    you need to change the following code.
    Instead of:

      ```js
       var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('asciidoctor-reveal.js');
       asciidoctorRevealjs.register()
       ```

    Use:

       ```js
       var asciidoctor = require('@asciidoctor/core')()
       var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('@asciidoctor/reveal.js')
       asciidoctorRevealjs.register()
       ```

  * Node.js package name changed from `asciidoctor-reveal.js` to `@asciidoctor/reveal.js` (
    [#252](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/252),
    [#291](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/291))
  * Custom CSS might require adjustments.
    Source and listing block encapsulation changed due to our migration to Asciidoctor 2.0.0 Syntax Highlighter API.
    See [#287](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/287).
  * Upgraded to Font-Awesome 5.8.2 from 4.3.0 which contains some backward incompatible changes ([#268](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/268))
  * Asciidoctor reveal.js now requires Asciidoctor 2.0.0+ or Asciidoctor.js 2.0.0+ ([#290](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/290))
  * Dropped support for end-of-life Ruby version 2.1 and 2.2 ([#247](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/247))

### Compliance

  * Added support for table frame, grid, header and alignment options ([#29](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/29), [#42](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/42), [#56](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/56), [#288](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/288))
  * Source code callout style aligned with Asciidoctor's ([#293](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/293), [#300](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/300))
  * Added support for Reveal.js data-background-opacity ([#269](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/269))
  * Added support for Reveal.js data-background-position ([#273](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/273), [#274](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/274))
  * Updated the process to include the generated converter in releases ([#265](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/265), [#302](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/302))

### Enhancements
  * Support for Asciidoctor.js 2.0.0+ which brings a command line interface ([#254](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/254))
  * Process updates, narrower install version range and compatibility matrix regarding Asciidoctor.js ([#187](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/187), [#303](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/303))

  * Added support for Reveal.js PDF export options ([#277](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/277))
  * Upgraded to Font-Awesome 5.8.2 ([#268](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/268))
  * We now accept `reveal.js` as converter/backend name in addition to `revealjs` ([#253](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/253), [#297](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/297))
  * Babel integration example API updated to use Asciidoctor reveal.js current API ([#285](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/285), [#298](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/298))
  * Node.js package clean-ups ([#279](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/279), [#281](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/281), [#282](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/282))

## 2.0.1 (2019-12-04)

### Important Bug Fix

  * Fixed an issue that caused all `reveal.js` options in CamelCase to use the default value instead of one specified as an AsciiDoc attribute ([#263](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/263), [#267](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/267))

### Compliance

  * Dropped support for verse table cells ([#246](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/246)).
    Asciidoctor 2.0 dropped it, we followed.

### Enhancements

  * Documentation improvements (
    [#264](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/264),
    [#278](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/278),
    [#280](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/280))

## 2.0.0 (2019-02-28)

### Upgrade considerations

  * Node.js API change!
    If you generate your reveal.js presentations using the node/javascript toolchain, you need to change how the Asciidoctor reveal.js back-end is registered to Asciidoctor.js.
    Instead of `require('asciidoctor-reveal.js')` you need to do:

       ```js
       var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('asciidoctor-reveal.js');
       asciidoctorRevealjs.register()
       ```
    This change enables new use cases like embedding a presentation in a React web app.

  * Anchor links generated by Asciidoctor reveal.js will change from now on when revealjs_history is set to true (default is false).
    This is the consequence of upstream fixing a long standing issue (see [#1230](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1230) and [#2037](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2037)) and us removing a workaround (see [#232](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/232)).
    Explicit anchors are not affected.
  * Custom CSS might require adjustments.
    Source and listing block are less deeply nested into `div` blocks now.
    See [#195](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/195) and [#223](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/223).
  * The reveal.js `marked` and `markdown` plugins are disabled by default now.
    It is unlikely that they could have been used anyway.
    See [#204](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/204).
  * Dropped the ability to override the Reveal.JS theme and transitions dynamically with the URL query.
    Was not compatible with Reveal.JS 3.x series released 4 years ago.

### Enhancements

  * Easier speaker notes: a `.notes` role that apply to many AsciiDoc blocks (open, sidebar and admonition) ([#202](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/202))
  * Added a role `right` that would apply a `float: right` to any block where it would be assigned ([#197](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/197), [#213](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/213), [#215](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/215))
  * Allow the background color of slides to be set using CSS ([#16](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/16), [#220](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/220), [#226](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/226), [#229](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/229))
  * Reveal.js's fragmentInURL option now supported ([#206](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/206), [#214](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/214))
  * Documentation improvements ([#141](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/141), [#182](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/182), [#190](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/190), [#203](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/203), [#215](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/215), [#216](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/216), [#222](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/222))
  * Support for Asciidoctor.js 1.5.6 and build simplification ([#189](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/189), [#217](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/217))
  * Support to specify and use reveal.js plugins without modifying Asciidoctor reveal.js's source code ([#196](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/196), [#118](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/118), [#201](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/201), [#204](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/204))
  * Node / Javascript back-end is now loaded on-demand with the `register()` method.
    This allows embedding Asciidoctor reveal.js into React or any other modern Javascript environment.
    ([#205](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/205), [#218](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/218), [#219](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/219))
  * `revealjsdir` attribute is set to a more sensible default when running under Node.js ([#191](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/191), [#228](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/228))
  * Node / Javascript back-end updated to use Asciidoctor.js 1.5.9.
    This extension is built with Opal 0.11.99.dev (6703d8d) in order to be compatible.
    ([#227](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/227), [#240](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/240))

### Compliance

  * AsciiDoc source callout icons now work ([#54](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/54), [#168](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/168), [#224](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/224))
  * New reveal.js 3.7.0 features supported: `controlsTutorial`, `controlsLayout`, `controlsBackArrows`, new `slideNumber` formats, `showSlideNumber`, `autoSlideMethod`, `parallaxBackgroundHorizontal`, `parallaxBackgroundVertical` and `display` configuration parameters are now supported ([#212](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/212), [#239](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/239), [#208](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/208), [#242](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/242))
  * Asciidoctor 2.0 ready ([#245](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/245))

### Bug Fixes

  * Reveal.js' `stretch` class now works with listing blocks ([#195](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/195), [#223](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/223))
  * Auto-generated slide IDs with unallowed characters (for revealjs history) now work properly.
    Upstream reveal.js fixed a bug in 3.7.0 ([#2037](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2037)) and we removed our broken workaround.
    ([#192](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/192), [#232](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/232))

### Infrastructure

  * Travis testing prepared for upcoming Asciidoctor 2.0 ([#216](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/216))
  * Travis testing for Ruby 2.6 ([#243](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/243))

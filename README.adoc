= reveal.js backend for Asciidoctor
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 2

The https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js[reveal.js backend] is a collection of Slim templates for https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor] that transform an AsciiDoc document into HTML5 slides animated by http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/[reveal.js].

//image:https://travis-ci.org/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js.svg?branch=master[Build Status,link=https://travis-ci.org/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js]


== Prerequisites

. Ensure Asciidoctor, Slim and their dependencies are installed (in their latest version):

  $ gem install asciidoctor tilt thread_safe slim

. Clone `asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js` to get templates for rendering presentation HTML:

  $ git clone git://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js.git

. Copy or clone presentation library (to output destination/branch)

  $ git clone -b 3.0.0 git://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git


== Rendering the AsciiDoc into slides

. Create content in a file (*.adoc, *.ad, etc.).
  See examples in <<Some Examples>> section to get started or files in `test/`.

. Generate HTML presentation from the Asciidoctor templates

  $ asciidoctor -T templates/slim CONTENT_FILE

NOTE: If you want to use reveal.js 2, please switch your asciidoctor-reveal.js repo to the reveal.js-2.x branch.

TIP: If you are using https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages], plan ahead by keeping your source files on `master` branch and all output files on the `gh-pages` branch.


== Some Examples

// FIXME: incomplete

Let's see some examples of `revealjs` backend features.

=== Basic presentation with speaker notes

----
= Title Slide

== Slide One

* Foo
* Bar
* World

== Slide Two

Hello World - Good Bye Cruel World

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Actually things aren't that bad
--
----

=== Background colors

In previous snippet we are creating a slide titled Slide One with bullets and another one titled Slide Two with centered text (reveal.js' default behavior) with https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes[speaker notes].

----
[data-background="yellow"]
== Slide Three

Is very yellow
----

Slide Three applies the attribute http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/14[data-background] to the `reveal.js` <section> tag.
Anything accepted by CSS color formats works.
Here is the https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds[upstream documentation].

=== Fragments

----
== Slide Four

[%step]
* this
* is
* revealed
* gradually
----

Slide Four has bullets that are revealed one after the other.
This is what `reveal.js` calls http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments[fragments].
Applying the step option or role on a list (`[%step]` or `[.step]`) will do the trick.
Here is https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#fragments[upstream documentation] on the topic.
Note that only `fade-in` is supported for lists at the moment.

=== Syntax highlighting

[listing]
....
== Slide Five

Uses highlighted code

----
print "Hello World"
----
....

`revealjs` uses https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] to do its syntax highlighting by default.
By default `[source]` blocks and blocks delimited by `----` will be highlighted.
An explicit `[listing]` block will not be highlighted.
`highlight.js` does language auto-detection but using the `language="..."` attribute will hint the highlighter.
For example this will highlight this source code as Perl:

[listing]
....
== Slide Five

[source,perl]
----
print "$0: hello world\n"
----
....

[NOTE]
Currently `revealjs` uses a rather old version of https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] that does not handle callouts correctly.
To fix this download a current version of https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] and copy it to `reveal.js/plugin/highlight/highlight.js`.

Alternatively, you can use http://coderay.rubychan.de[Coderay] or http://pygments.org[Pygments] as the highlighter.
These handle callouts correctly.

To use http://coderay.rubychan.de[Coderay]:

----
= Title slide
:source-highlighter: coderay
----

To use http://pygments.org[Pygments]:

----
= Title slide
:source-highlighter: pygments
----

=== Vertical slides

[listing]
....
== Slide Six

Top slide

=== Slide Six.One

This is a vertical subslide
....

Slide Six uses the vertical slide feature of `reveal.js`.
Slide Six.One will be rendered vertically below Slide Six.
Here is https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup[upstream documentation] on that topic.

=== Slides without titles

There are a few ways to have no titles on slides.

* Setting your title to `!`
* Adding the `notitle` option to your slide
* Adding the `conceal` option to your slide

Here is an example of the three techniques in action:

----
include::test/concealed-slide-titles.adoc[]
----

NOTE: `conceal` and `notitle` have the advantage that the slide still has an id so it can be linked to.

== About Jade Templates

`/templates/jade` directory contains jade template files they are ported from `/templates/slim` templates. These templates were written to support reveal.js backend for Asciidoctor.js environment that is currently using in https://github.com/asciidocfx/AsciidocFX[AsciidocFX] editor. You can look at the https://github.com/asciidocfx/asciidoctor.js-reveal-demo[demo].

// IMPORTANT: Changes made to this description should be sync'ed with the readme field in package.json.
{uri-project-repo}[Asciidoctor reveal.js] is a converter for {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] and {uri-asciidoctorjs}[Asciidoctor.js] that transforms an AsciiDoc document into an HTML5 presentation designed to be executed by the {uri-revealjs-home}[reveal.js] presentation framework.

TIP: Want to see some example presentations, see <<Showcase Presentations>>

There are four main technology stacks that can convert AsciiDoc into HTML5 / reveal.js:

* Asciidoctor / Ruby / Bundler (See <<Ruby Setup>>)
* Asciidoctor.js / JavaScript (Node.js) / npm (See <<Node / JavaScript Setup>>)
* Standalone Executable (See <<Standalone Executable>>)
* AsciidoctorJ / JVM / Maven (See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj-reveal.js[this project])

== Ruby Setup

NOTE: asciidoctor-reveal.js is now a Ruby Gem.
To ensure repeatability, we recommend that you manage your presentation projects using bundler.

For a quick start clone our https://github.com/obilodeau/presentation-revealjs-starter[starter repository] and follow instructions there.

For more complete instructions, read on.


=== Prerequisites

. Install http://bundler.io/[bundler] (if not already installed)  using your system's package manager or with:

  $ gem install bundler

. If you're using RVM, make sure you switch away from any gemset:

  $ rvm use default
+
or
+
  $ rvm use system


=== Install

NOTE: These instructions should be repeated for every presentation project.

. Create project directory

  $ mkdir my-awesome-presentation
  $ cd my-awesome-presentation

. Create a file named `Gemfile` with the following content:
+
[source,ruby]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'asciidoctor-revealjs' # latest released version
----
+
NOTE: For some reason, when you use the system Ruby on Fedora, you also have to add the json gem to the Gemfile.
+
. Install the gems into the project

  $ bundle config --local github.https true
  $ bundle --path=.bundle/gems --binstubs=.bundle/.bin

. Optional: Copy or clone reveal.js presentation framework.
  Allows you to modify themes or view slides offline.

  $ git clone -b 3.9.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git


=== Rendering the AsciiDoc into slides

. Create content in a file (*.adoc, *.ad, etc.).
  See examples in <<Syntax Examples>> section to get started.

. Generate HTML presentation from the AsciiDoc source

  $ bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs \
    -a revealjsdir=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js@3.9.2 CONTENT_FILE.adoc

. If you did the optional step of having a local reveal.js clone you can
  convert AsciiDoc source with

  $ bundle exec asciidoctor-revealjs CONTENT_FILE.adoc

TIP: If you are using https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages], plan ahead by keeping your source files on `master` branch and all output files on the `gh-pages` branch.


== Node / JavaScript Setup

=== Prerequisites

First you must install and configure {uri-nodejs-download}[Node] on your machine.

[[node-install]]
=== Install

We recommend to install the dependencies in a project directory, such as the directory where your AsciiDoc presentations are stored.
If you don't have a `package.json` file in your project directory, you can create one to eliminate warnings during the installation using:

 $ npm init -y

You can now install the dependencies:

 $ npm i --save asciidoctor@^2.0 @asciidoctor/reveal.js

=== Convert AsciiDoc into slides

Once the dependencies are installed, verify that the `asciidoctor-revealjs` command is available.
On Linux and macOS, open a terminal and type:

 $ npx asciidoctor-revealjs --version

On Windows, open PowerShell and type:

 $ .\node_modules\.bin\asciidoctor-revealjs.cmd --version

The command should report the Asciidoctor CLI version in the terminal:

[source,console]
----
Asciidoctor.js 2.0.3 (Asciidoctor 2.0.9) [https://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (node v10.15.1 on linux)
CLI version 2.0.1
----

If you don't have an existing presentation, you can create a sample presentation named [.path]_presentation.adoc_:

.presentation.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Title Slide

== Slide One

* Foo
* Bar
* World

----

To convert the sample presentation into slides, open a terminal and type:

 $ npx asciidoctor-revealjs presentation.adoc

On windows, open PowerShell and type:

 $ .\node_modules\.bin\asciidoctor-revealjs.cmd presentation.adoc

The above command will generate a file named [.path]_presentation.html_.
You can open this file in a browser.

==== Using the JavaScript API

Alternatively, you can use the JavaScript API to register the converter and convert a document:

.convert-slides.js
[source,javascript]
----
// Load Asciidoctor.js and the reveal.js converter
var asciidoctor = require('@asciidoctor/core')()
var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('@asciidoctor/reveal.js')
asciidoctorRevealjs.register()

// Convert the document 'presentation.adoc' using the reveal.js converter
var options = { safe: 'safe', backend: 'revealjs' }
asciidoctor.convertFile('presentation.adoc', options) // <1>
----
<1> Creates a file named `presentation.html` (in the directory where command is run)

To execute the script, open a terminal and type:

 $ node convert-slides.js

You can open the `presentation.html` file in your browser and enjoy!


== Standalone Executable

Pre-built binary packages can be downloaded from our {uri-project-repo}/releases[GitHub release page].
We provide them for Windows 64-bit, Linux 64-bit and macOS 64-bit.
Open an issue if your platform isn't supported.
The executables are built using the <<Node / JavaScript Setup,Node / JavaScript>> toolchain.

=== Install

* {uri-project-repo}/releases[Download the executable] for your platform and make it executable with `chmod` or using the files properties' user interface.
* Copy or clone the reveal.js presentation framework in the directory where you will build your slidedeck.
  Here we do a shallow clone of the repo:

  $ git clone -b 3.9.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git

=== Convert AsciiDoc into slides

Open a terminal where the executable is and type:

 $ ./asciidoctor-revealjs --version

The command should report the Asciidoctor reveal.js and Asciidoctor CLI version in the terminal:

[source,console]
----
Asciidoctor reveal.js 3.0.1 using Asciidoctor.js 2.0.3 (Asciidoctor 2.0.9) [https://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (node v12.13.1 on linux)
CLI version 3.1.0
----

If you don't have an existing presentation, you can create a sample presentation named [.path]_presentation.adoc_:

.presentation.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Title Slide
:revealjsdir: reveal.js

== Slide One

* Foo
* Bar
* World

----

To convert the sample presentation into slides, open a terminal and type:

 $ ./asciidoctor-revealjs presentation.adoc

The above command will generate a file named [.path]_presentation.html_.
You can open this file in a browser.


== Syntax Examples

Let's see some examples of `revealjs` backend features.
Additional examples can be found in the AsciiDoc files (.adoc) in `examples/`.

=== Basic presentation with speaker notes

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Title Slide

== Slide One

* Foo
* Bar
* World

== Slide Two

A Great Story

[.notes]
--
* tell anecdote
* make a point
--
----

In previous snippet we are creating a slide titled Slide One with bullets and another one titled Slide Two with centered text (reveal.js`' default behavior) with {uri-revealjs-gh}#speaker-notes[speaker notes].
Other syntax exists to create speaker notes, see `examples/speaker-notes.adoc`.

Starting with Reveal.js 3.5 speaker notes supports configurable layouts:
image:https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/629429/21808439/b941eb52-d743-11e6-9936-44ef80c60580.gif[]

Speaker notes are opened by pressing `s`.
With Reveal.js 3.5 they require a webserver to work.
This limitation is not present in 3.6.
You can get a Web server running quickly with:

    ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000 -b 127.0.0.1

Then use your browser to navigate to the URL \http://localhost:5000.

=== Slides without titles

There are a few ways to have no titles on slides.

* Setting your title to `!`
* Adding the `notitle` option to your slide
* Adding the `conceal` option to your slide

ifeval::[{safe-mode-level} >= 20]
See <<examples/concealed-slide-titles.adoc#,concealed-slide-titles.adoc>>.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{safe-mode-level} < 20]
Here is an example of the three techniques in action:

.concealed-slide-titles.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
....
include::examples/concealed-slide-titles.adoc[lines=5..-1]
....
endif::[]

NOTE: `conceal` and `notitle` have the advantage that the slide still has an id so it can be linked to.

IMPORTANT: Like the first page of an AsciiDoc document, the first slide is handled differently.
           To hide the whole slide use the `:notitle:` http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#header-summary[document attribute].
           To achieve the effect of hiding only the first slide's title, combine the `:notitle:` attribute on the first slide and use `[%notitle]` on the second slide which will, in effect, be your first slide now.


=== Background Colors

Background colors for slides can be specified by two means: a classic one and one using AsciiDoc roles.
See <<examples/background-color.adoc#,background-color.adoc>> for more examples.

==== Using AsciiDoc Roles

Using roles respects the AsciiDoc philosophy of separation of content and presentation.
Colors are to be defined by CSS and the <<customcss,`:customcss:` attribute>> need to be used to specify the CSS file to load.
To avoid clashing with existing reveal.js themes or CSS, a specific CSS class called `background` is expected to be present.
Here is an example:


[source, asciidoc]
----
= Title
:customcss: my-css.css

[.red.background]
== Slide One

Is very red
----

.my-css.css
[source, css]
----
section.red.background {
  background-color: red;
}
----

NOTE: The `canvas` keyword can be used instead of `background` for the same effect.

==== Classic

[source, asciidoc]
----
[background-color="yellow"]
== Slide Three

Is very yellow
----

Slide Three applies the attribute {uri-revealjs-gh}#slide-backgrounds[data-background-color] to the `reveal.js` <section> tag.
Anything accepted by CSS color formats works.


=== Background images

[source, asciidoc]
----
[%notitle]
== Grand Announcement

image::cover.jpg[background, size=cover]
----

This will put `cover.jpg` as the slide's background image.
It sets reveal.js`' `data-background-image` attribute.
The `size` attribute is also supported.
See the {uri-revealjs-gh}#image-backgrounds[relevant reveal.js documentation] for details.

NOTE: Background images file names are now relative to the `:imagesdir:` attribute if set.

NOTE: The `canvas` keyword can be used instead of `background` for the same effect.

[source, asciidoc]
----
[%notitle]
== The Great Goat

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Hausziege_04.jpg[canvas,size=contain]
----

As you can see, you can use a URL to specify your image resource too.


[#background_videos]
=== Background videos

A background video for a slide can be specified using the `background-video` element attribute.

[source, asciidoc]
----
[background-video="https://my.video/file.mp4",background-video-loop=true,background-video-muted=true]
== Nice background!
----

For convenience `background-video-loop` and `background-video-muted` attributes are mapped to `loop` and `muted` options which can be specified with `options="loop,muted"`.

For example:

[source, asciidoc]
----
[background-video="https://my.video/file.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Nice background!
----

See {uri-revealjs-gh}#video-backgrounds[the relevant reveal.js documentation] for details.
Note that the `data-` prefix is not required in asciidoc files.


=== Background iframes

The background can be replaced with anything a browser can render in an iframe using the `background-iframe` reveal.js feature.

[source, asciidoc]
----
[%notitle,background-iframe="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaApqL4QjH8?rel=0&start=3&enablejsapi=1&autoplay=1&loop=1&controls=0&modestbranding=1"]
== a youtube video
----

See {uri-revealjs-gh}#iframe-backgrounds[the relevant reveal.js documentation] for details.


=== Slide Transitions

[source, asciidoc]
----
[transition=zoom, %notitle]
== Zoom zoom

This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!

[transition-speed=fast, %notitle]
== Speed

Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!
----

See {uri-revealjs-gh}#slide-transitions[the relevant reveal.js documentation] for details.


=== Fragments

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Slide Four

[%step]
* this
* is
* revealed
* gradually
----

Slide Four has bullets that are revealed one after the other.
This is what `reveal.js` calls http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments[fragments].
Applying the step option or role on a list (`[%step]` or `[.step]`) will do the trick.
Here is {uri-revealjs-gh}#fragments[the relevant reveal.js
documentation] on the topic.
Note that only `fade-in` is supported for lists at the moment.


=== Stretch class attribute

Reveal.js supports a special class that will give all available screen space to an HTML node.
This class element is named `stretch`.

Sometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide.

To apply that class to block simply use asciidoctor's class assignment:

    [.stretch]

See {uri-revealjs-gh}#stretching-elements[reveal.js documentation on stretching elements].


=== Videos

In addition to <<Background videos,background videos>>, videos can be inserted directly into slides.
The syntax is the standard http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#video[asciidoc video block macro] syntax.

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Trains, we love trains!

video::kZH9JtPBq7k[youtube, start=34, options=autoplay]
----

By default videos are given as much space as possible.
To override that behavior use the `width` and `height` named attributes.


=== Syntax highlighting

reveal.js is well integrated with https://highlightjs.org/[Highlight.js] for syntax highlighting.
Asciidoctor reveal.js supports that.
You can activate Highlight.js syntax highlighting (disabled by default) by setting the `source-highlighter` document attribute as follows:

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Presentation Title
// [...] other document attributes
:source-highlighter: highlightjs
----

[NOTE]
----
By default, we are using a prebuilt version of Highlight.js with 34 commonly used languages hosted on https://cdnjs.com/[cdnjs].
You can load additionnal languages using the `:highlightjs-languages:` attribute:

```
// load yaml and scilab languages
:highlightjs-languages: yaml, scilab
```

You can also load Highlight.js from a custom base directory (or remote URL) using the `:highlightjsdir:` attribute:

```
// load from a local path
:highlightjsdir: highlight
// load from jsdelivr CDN
//:highlightjsdir: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@9.18.0/build
----

Once enabled, you can write code blocks as usual:

[source, asciidoc]
....
== Slide Five

Uses highlighted code

[source, python]
----
print "Hello World"
----
....

By default `[source]` blocks and blocks delimited by `----` will be highlighted.
An explicit `[listing]` block will not be highlighted.
`highlight.js` does language auto-detection but using the `language="..."` attribute will hint the highlighter.
For example this will highlight this source code as Perl:

[source, asciidoc]
....
== Slide Five

[source,perl]
----
print "$0: hello world\n"
----
....

[NOTE]
Alternatively, you can use http://rouge.jneen.net/[Rouge], http://coderay.rubychan.de[Coderay] or http://pygments.org[Pygments] as syntax highlighters,
if you are using the Asciidoctor/Ruby/Bundler toolchain (not Asciidoctor.js/JavaScript/npm).
Check the `examples/` directory for examples and notes about what needs to be done for them to work.
They are considered unsupported by the asciidoctor-reveal.js project.


=== Vertical slides

[source, asciidoc]
....
== Slide Six

Top slide

=== Slide Six.One

This is a vertical subslide
....

Slide Six uses the vertical slide feature of `reveal.js`.
Slide Six.One will be rendered vertically below Slide Six.
Here is {uri-revealjs-gh}#markup[the relevant reveal.js
documentation] on that topic.

=== Columns layout

Inspired by https://bulma.io/[Bulma], Asciidoctor reveal.js supports columns layout out-of-the-box:

[source, asciidoc]
....
[.columns]
== 2 columns

[.column]
--
* **Edgar Allen Poe**
* Sheri S. Tepper
* Bill Bryson
--

[.column]
--
Edgar Allan Poe (/poʊ/; born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic.
--
....

If you do not specify a size, each column will have an equal width, no matter the number of columns.

[source, asciidoc]
....
[.columns]
== 3 columns

[.column]
* Java
* **Kotlin**

[.column]
* Node
* **Deno**

[.column]
* Ruby
* **Crystal**
....

If you want to change the size of a single column, you can use one of the following classes:

* `is-three-quarters`
* `is-two-thirds`
* `is-half`
* `is-one-third`
* `is-one-quarter`
* `is-full`

The other columns will fill up the remaining space automatically. +
You can use the following multiples of 20% as well:

* `is-four-fifths`
* `is-three-fifths`
* `is-two-fifths`
* `is-one-fifth`

[source, asciidoc]
....
[.columns]
== Columns with size

[.column.is-one-third]
--
* **Kotlin**
* Java
* Scala
--

[.column]
--
Programming language for Android, mobile cross-platform
and web development, server-side, native,
and data science. Open source forever Github.
--
....

The vertical alignment of columns defaults to top aligned.
Content can be centered by adding the `is-vcentered` class to the slide.

[source, asciidoc]
....
[.columns.is-vcentered]
== Columns Vertically Centered

[.column]
--
* Few
* Bullets
* Here
--

[.column]
image::large-image.png[]
....


=== Asciidoctor reveal.js specific roles

Roles are usually applied with the following syntax where the `important-text` CSS class would be applied to the slide title in the generated HTML:

[source, asciidoc]
....
[.important-text]
== Slide Title

* Some
* Information
....

Or

[source, asciidoc]
....
[role="important-text"]
== Slide Title

* Some
* Information
....

See https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#role[Asciidoctor's documentation] for more details.

.Image specific note
In addition to the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/\#positioning-attributes[existing attributes] to position images, roles can be used as well. However, the shorthand syntax (.) doesn't work in the image macro arguments but must be used above with the angle bracket syntax.
See <<examples/images.adoc#,images.adoc>> for examples.

Here is a list of supported roles:

right:: Will apply a `float: right` style to the affected block


=== Asciidoctor reveal.js specific attributes

==== iFrame Preview Overlay

The reveal.js feature activated by a global `previewLinks: true` configuration or by adding the `data-preview-link` HTML attribute to `<a>` tags can be activated by using special AsciiDoc attributes.

On links use the `preview=true` attribute, on images use the `link_preview=true` attribute and globally you can set `:revealjs_previewlinks:` attribute.

See <<examples/links.adoc#,links.adoc>> and <<examples/links-preview.adoc#,links-preview.adoc>> for examples.


=== Title slide customization

The title slide is customized via Asciidoc attributes.
These are the global variable assigned at the top of a document under the lead
title that look like this: `:name: value`.

This converter supports changing the color, image, video, iframe and
transitions of the title slide.

Read {uri-revealjs-gh}#slide-backgrounds[the relevant reveal.js documentation] to understand what attributes need to be set.
Keep in mind that for title slides you must replace `data-` with `title-slide-`.

ifeval::[{safe-mode-level} >= 20]
See <<examples/title-slide-image.adoc#,title-slide-image.adoc>>.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{safe-mode-level} < 20]
Here is an example:

.title-slide-image.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
....
include::examples/title-slide-image.adoc[lines=5..-1]
....
endif::[]

The title slide is also added a `title` CSS class to help with template customization.

=== Content meant for multiple converters

Some content can be created with both slides and book in mind.

To mark slides split points you can use preprocessor conditionals combined
with a backend declaration.
Breaking points are set using slides with no title `=== !` wrapped in a
conditional: `ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]`.
In the end, the whole document has to be compiled with the backend option:
`-b revealjs`

For example:

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Main section

=== Sub Section

Small +
Multiline +
intro

. very
. long
. list
. of
. items

\ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

Some overview diagram

\ifdef::backend-revealjs[=== !]

Detailed view diagram
----


[[customcss]]
=== CSS override

If you use the `:customcss:` document attribute, a CSS file of the name given in the attribute is added to the list of CSS resources loaded by the rendered HTML.
Doing so, you can then easily override specific elements of your theme per presentation.

For example, to do proper position-independent text placement of a title slide with a specific background you can use:

[source, css]
----
.reveal section.title h1 {
    margin-top: 2.3em;
}

.reveal section.title small {
    margin-top: 15.3em;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: white;
}
----

If the `:customcss:` attribute value is empty then `asciidoctor-revealjs.css` is the CSS resource that the presentation is linked to.


=== Slide state

Reveal.js supports a {uri-revealjs-gh}#slide-states[data-state] tag that can be added on slides which gets rendered into `<section>` tags.
In AsciiDoc the `data-state` can be applied to a slide by adding a state attribute to a section like this:

[source, asciidoc]
----
[state=topic]
== Epic Topic
----

That state can be queried from JavaScript or used in CSS to apply further customization to your slide deck.
For example, by combining this feature with the <<CSS override>> one, you can alter fonts for specific pages with this CSS:

[source, css]
----
@import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Baloo+Bhai';

section[data-state="topic"] h2 {
    font-family: 'Baloo Bhai', cursive;
    font-size: 4em;
}
----

=== Admonitions

Asciidoctor font-based http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#admonition[admonitions] are supported.
Make sure to add the following attribute to your document:

[source, asciidoc]
----
:icons: font
----

Here is an example slide:

[source, asciidoc]
----
== But first

WARNING: This presentation is dangerous!
----

Here are details about Asciidoctor's http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#admonition-icons[Admonition icons] support.

=== Supplemental Content with Docinfo
// Originally from https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-bespoke#supplemental-content

It's possible to inject supplemental content into the output document using http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#docinfo-file[docinfo files].
This core feature of AsciiDoc has been adapted to work with the reveal.js converter.

Currently, there are three insertion locations for docinfo content in a reveal.js document:

head:: content is inserted after the last child of the `<head>` element
header:: content is inserted before the first child of the `<div class="slides">` element (before the slides)
footer:: content is inserted after the last child of the `<div class="slides">` element (after the slides)

The content you want to insert goes into a sibling file of the slide deck document with the following filename patterns:

head:: `docinfo-revealjs.html`
header:: `docinfo-header-revealjs.html`
footer:: `docinfo-footer-revealjs.html`

For example, let's say you want to embed a tweet into your slide deck.
You might inject the shared embedding JavaScript using a footer docinfo file:

.src/docinfo-footer-revealjs.html
[source,html]
----
<script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
----

You then need to set the following document attribute in the AsciiDoc header:

----
:docinfo: shared
----

When this attribute is defined, the converter will automatically read the docinfo file(s) and insert the contents into the specified location in the output document.

Some attributes can be set at the top of the document that are specific to the `reveal.js` converter.
They use the same name as in the `reveal.js` project except that they are prepended by `revealjs_` and case doesn't matter.
They are applied in the link:templates/document.html.slim[document template].

NOTE: Default settings are based on `reveal.js` default settings.

|===

If you want to build a custom theme or customize an existing one you should
look at the
{uri-revealjs-gh}/blob/master/css/theme/README.md[reveal.js
theme documentation] and use the `revealjs_customtheme` AsciiDoc attribute to
activate it.


=== PDF Export

Follow https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export[reveal.js' documentation] for PDF export.
We would add that we have successfully used PDF export without the requirement of a Web server.


=== Default plugins

By default, generated presentations will have the following reveal.js plugins enabled:

* plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js
* plugin/notes/notes.js

All these plugins are part of the reveal.js distribution.

To enable or disable a built-in plugin, it is possible to set the `revealjs_plugin_[plugin name]` attribute to `enable` or `disable`.

For example, to disable all the default plugins set the following document attributes:

----
:revealjs_plugin_zoom: disabled
:revealjs_plugin_notes: disabled
----


=== Additional plugins

Additional reveal.js plugins can be installed and activated using AsciiDoc attributes and external javascript files.

. Extract the plugin files in a directory
. Create a JavaScript file that will contain the JavaScript statements to load the plugin (only one required even if you are using several plugins)
. Add a `:revealjs_plugins:` attribute to point to that JavaScript file
. (Optional) Add a `:revealjs_plugins_configuration:` attribute to point to a JavaScript file that configures the plugins you use

Looking at the example provided in the repository will provide guidance: link:examples/revealjs-plugins.adoc[AsciiDoc source], link:examples/revealjs-plugins.js[Plugin Loader], link:examples/revealjs-plugins-conf.js[Plugin Configuration].

Read {uri-revealjs-gh}#dependencies[the relevant reveal.js documentation] to understand more about reveal.js plugins.
A {uri-revealjs-gh}/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware[list of existing reveal.js plugins] is also maintained upstream.

[[revealjs-compatibility-matrix]]
== reveal.js Compatibility Matrix

We try as much as possible to be compatible with a broad range of reveal.js versions.
However, changes made by that project sometimes forces us to drop compatibility with older reveal.js releases.
This table tracks this compatibility.

|===
|Asciidoctor reveal.js version |reveal.js version

|4.x
|3.9 - 3.8

|3.x, 2.x, 1.x
|3.7 - 3.0

|Unversioned releases
|2.x

[[asciidoctorjs-compatibility-matrix]]
== Asciidoctor.js Compatibility Matrix

NOTE: This section is intended only for more advanced users who combine extensions or maintain slide decks over many releases and need to update their dependencies.

Due to our Ruby to JavaScript conversion process, published npm packages have strict requirements with which version of Asciidoctor.js they are compatible with.
This table tracks this compatibility.

|===
|Asciidoctor-reveal.js version |Asciidoctor.js version

|3.x
|2.x

|2.x
|1.5.9

|1.1.x
|1.5.6-preview.4
|===

Be aware that it is always possible to recompile the converter into JavaScript from source so compatibility can be created by anyone if needed.
More details on that topic can be found link:HACKING.adoc#node-binary-compatibility[in the development guide].

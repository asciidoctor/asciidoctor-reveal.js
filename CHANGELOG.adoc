== <master> (<unreleased)

Upgrade considerations::
  * Due to an upstream change in reveal.js 3.8.0, this back-end no longer supports earlier reveal.js versions.
    We added a compatibility matrix with reveal.js at the end of the README.
    See {uri-issue}301[#301] for details.
  * Using the attribute `background-opacity` to alter the opacity of the title slide no longer works.
    When the opacity feature was introduced we forgot to align with the other title slide attributes.
    The feature was introduced in 3.0.0 and the bug stayed in 3.1.0.
    Starting with 4.0.0 use `title-slide-background-opacity` instead.
    See issue {uri-issue}323[#323] for details.
  * Our support of AsciiDoc `docinfo` attribute changed.
    We were previously injecting `docinfo-header.html` somewhere in the HTML `<head>`.
    Now, `docinfo-revealjs.html` goes last into the HTML `<head>`, `docinfo-header-revealjs.html` goes right before the first slide `<section>` and `docinfo-footer-revealjs.html` goes right after the last slide `<section>`.
    The new documentation is available https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js#supplemental-content-with-docinfo[here] and the related tickets are {uri-issue}198[#198] and {uri-issue}324[#324].
  * Default highlight.js theme is monokai. This follows a reveal.js change.

Enhancements::
  * Built-in slim templates can now be overridden with `--template-dir` or `-T` ({uri-issue}177[#177], {uri-issue}318[#318])
  * Documentation improvements ({uri-issue}322[#322])

Compliance::
  * New reveal.js 3.8.0 and 3.9.0 features supported
    * Line numbers on source code blocks using Asciidoctor's `linenums` attribute
    * Specific lines and step-by-step code highlights using Asciidoctor's `highlight` attribute
    * reveal.js `data-preview` on links and images with link can be activated by using the `preview` and `link_preview` Asciidoctor attributes respectively
    * New configuration options: `hash`, `navigationMode`, `shuffle`, `preloadIframes`, `totalTime`, `minimumTimePerSlide`, `hideInactiveCursor`, `hideCursorTime`, `previewLinks` (`data-preview-link`) and `mobileViewDistance` ({uri-issue}301[#301])
  * Added support for the `sectnums` AsciiDoc attribute ({uri-issue}185[#185], {uri-issue}317[#317])
  * Aligned our `docinfo` support to Asciidoctor Bespoke ({uri-issue}198[#198], {uri-issue}324[#324])
  * `background-opacity` title slide attribute renamed to `title-slide-background-opacity` ({uri-issue}323[#323], {uri-issue}325[#325])

Bug Fixes::
  * Interactive debugging works again ({uri-issue}322[#322])


== 3.1.0 (2020-01-18)

Fixed a regression with Font-Awesome brand icons, added a JavaScript CLI and standalone executables for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Enhancements::
  * We now provide native standalone executables for Windows, Linux and macOS using a Node to binary packager ({uri-issue}259[#259], {uri-issue}308[#308])
  * JavaScript stack now provides a CLI usable with `npx asciidoctor-revealjs` ({uri-issue}308[#308])
  * Updated to Font-Awesome 5.12.0 ({uri-issue}305[#305])
  * Ruby command line interface now shows {project-name} version in addition to Asciidoctor version ({uri-issue}313[#313])
  * Updated dependencies: rake
  * Better tests ({uri-issue}310[#310], {uri-issue}311[#311])

Bug Fixes::
  * Added compatibility shim to Font Awesome 5 to fix brand icons rendering and more ({uri-issue}304[#304], {uri-issue}305[#305])

== 3.0.0 (2020-01-07)

An API breaking release for Asciidoctor.js users that brings a bright future of long term stability.
New Reveal.js features supported: background opacity, background positions, and PDF export.
AsciiDoc table options now supported.
A big FontAwesome update.
Many other little improvements and polish.

Special heads-up: we are already planning for another major release since Reveal.js 3.8 support will be considered a breaking change.
They changed how it is loaded and requires a template change incompatible with Reveal.js 3.1-3.7.

Upgrade considerations::
  * Node.js packaging changes!
    With the arrival of Asciidoctor.js 2.0.0 you can now use a command line interface (CLI) just like with Asciidoctor Ruby:

    $(npm bin)/asciidoctor -r @asciidoctor/reveal.js -b revealjs presentation.adoc
+
If you want to keep generating your reveal.js presentations using the Node.js API, you need to change the following code.
Instead of:

    var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('asciidoctor-reveal.js');
    asciidoctorRevealjs.register()
+
Use:

    var asciidoctor = require('@asciidoctor/core')()
    var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('@asciidoctor/reveal.js')
    asciidoctorRevealjs.register()
+
  * Node.js package name changed from `asciidoctor-reveal.js` to `@asciidoctor/reveal.js` ({uri-issue}252[#252], {uri-issue}291[#291])
  * Custom CSS might require adjustments.
    Source and listing block encapsulation changed due to our migration to Asciidoctor 2.0.0 Syntax Highlighter API.
    See {uri-issue}287[#287].
  * Upgraded to Font-Awesome 5.8.2 from 4.3.0 which contains some backward incompatible changes ({uri-issue}268[#268])
  * {project-name} now requires Asciidoctor 2.0.0+ or Asciidoctor.js 2.0.0+ ({uri-issue}290[#290])
  * Dropped support for end-of-life Ruby version 2.1 and 2.2 ({uri-issue}247[#247])

Compliance::
  * Added support for table frame, grid, header and alignment options ({uri-issue}29[#29], {uri-issue}42[#42], {uri-issue}56[#56], {uri-issue}288[#288])
  * Source code callout style aligned with Asciidoctor's ({uri-issue}293[#293], {uri-issue}300[#300])
  * Added support for Reveal.js data-background-opacity ({uri-issue}269[#269])
  * Added support for Reveal.js data-background-position ({uri-issue}273[#273], {uri-issue}274[#274])
  * Updated the process to include the generated converter in releases ({uri-issue}265[#265], {uri-issue}302[#302])

Enhancements::
  * Support for Asciidoctor.js 2.0.0+ which brings a command line interface ({uri-issue}254[#254])
  * Process updates, narrower install version range and compatibility matrix regarding Asciidoctor.js ({uri-issue}187[#187], {uri-issue}303[#303])
  * Migrated to Asciidoctor 2.0.0 new https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/releases/tag/v2.0.0[Syntax Highlighter API] ({uri-issue}261[#261], {uri-issue}287[#287])
  * Added support for Reveal.js PDF export options ({uri-issue}277[#277])
  * Upgraded to Font-Awesome 5.8.2 ({uri-issue}268[#268])
  * We now accept `reveal.js` as converter/backend name in addition to `revealjs` ({uri-issue}253[#253], {uri-issue}297[#297])
  * Babel integration example API updated to use {project-name} current API ({uri-issue}285[#285], {uri-issue}298[#298])
  * Node.js package clean-ups ({uri-issue}279[#279], {uri-issue}281[#281], {uri-issue}282[#282])
  * Upgrade Opal to use a compatible version with Asciidoctor.js 2.0.3 ({uri-issue}289[#289])
  * Documentation improvements ({uri-issue}292[#292], {uri-issue}302[#302])
  * Improvements to tests ({uri-issue}294[#294])

Bug Fixes::
  * Babel integration example updated for security ({uri-issue}285[#285])

Infrastructure::

== 2.0.1 (2019-12-04)

Important Bug Fix::
  * Fixed an issue that caused all `reveal.js` options in CamelCase to use the default value instead of one specified as an AsciiDoc attribute ({uri-issue}263[#263], {uri-issue}267[#267])

Compliance::
  * Dropped support for verse table cells ({uri-issue}246[#246]).
    Asciidoctor 2.0 dropped it, we followed.

Enhancements::
  * Documentation improvements ({uri-issue}264[#264], {uri-issue}278[#278], {uri-issue}280[#280])

Bug Fixes::
  * Yarn.lock updates for security ({uri-issue}283[#283])

== 2.0.0 (2019-02-28)

Upgrade considerations::
  * Node.js API change!
    If you generate your reveal.js presentations using the node/javascript toolchain, you need to change how the {project-name} back-end is registered to Asciidoctor.js.
    Instead of `require('asciidoctor-reveal.js')` you need to do:

    var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('asciidoctor-reveal.js');
    asciidoctorRevealjs.register()
+
This change enables new use cases like embedding a presentation in a React web app.

  * Anchor links generated by {project-name} will change from now on when revealjs_history is set to true (default is false).
    This is the consequence of upstream fixing a long standing issue (see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1230[#1230] and https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2037[#2037]) and us removing a workaround (see {uri-issue}232[#232]).
    Explicit anchors are not affected.
  * Custom CSS might require adjustments.
    Source and listing block are less deeply nested into `div` blocks now.
    See {uri-issue}195[#195] and {uri-issue}223[#223].
  * The reveal.js `marked` and `markdown` plugins are disabled by default now.
    It is unlikely that they could have been used anyway.
    See {uri-issue}204[#204].
  * Dropped the ability to override the Reveal.JS theme and transitions dynamically with the URL query.
    Was not compatible with Reveal.JS 3.x series released 4 years ago.

Enhancements::
  * Easier speaker notes: a `.notes` role that apply to many AsciiDoc blocks (open, sidebar and admonition) ({uri-issue}202[#202])
  * Added a role `right` that would apply a `float: right` to any block where it would be assigned ({uri-issue}197[#197], {uri-issue}213[#213], {uri-issue}215[#215])
  * Allow the background color of slides to be set using CSS ({uri-issue}16[#16], {uri-issue}220[#220], {uri-issue}226[#226], {uri-issue}229[#229])
  * Reveal.js's fragmentInURL option now supported ({uri-issue}206[#206], {uri-issue}214[#214])
  * Documentation improvements ({uri-issue}141[#141], {uri-issue}182[#182], {uri-issue}190[#190], {uri-issue}203[#203], {uri-issue}215[#215], {uri-issue}216[#216], {uri-issue}222[#222])
  * Support for Asciidoctor.js 1.5.6 and build simplification ({uri-issue}189[#189], {uri-issue}217[#217])
  * Support to specify and use reveal.js plugins without modifying {project-name}'s source code ({uri-issue}196[#196], {uri-issue}118[#118], {uri-issue}201[#201], {uri-issue}204[#204])
  * Node / Javascript back-end is now loaded on-demand with the `register()` method.
    This allows embedding {project-name} into React or any other modern Javascript environment.
    ({uri-issue}205[#205], {uri-issue}218[#218], {uri-issue}219[#219])
  * `revealjsdir` attribute is set to a more sensible default when running under Node.js ({uri-issue}191[#191], {uri-issue}228[#228])
  * Node / Javascript back-end updated to use Asciidoctor.js 1.5.9.
    This extension is built with Opal 0.11.99.dev (6703d8d) in order to be compatible.
    ({uri-issue}227[#227], {uri-issue}240[#240])

Compliance::
  * AsciiDoc source callout icons now work ({uri-issue}54[#54], {uri-issue}168[#168], {uri-issue}224[#224])
  * New reveal.js 3.7.0 features supported: `controlsTutorial`, `controlsLayout`, `controlsBackArrows`, new `slideNumber` formats, `showSlideNumber`, `autoSlideMethod`, `parallaxBackgroundHorizontal`, `parallaxBackgroundVertical` and `display` configuration parameters are now supported ({uri-issue}212[#212], {uri-issue}239[#239], {uri-issue}208[#208], {uri-issue}242[#242])
  * Asciidoctor 2.0 ready ({uri-issue}245[#245])

Bug Fixes::
  * Reveal.js' `stretch` class now works with listing blocks ({uri-issue}195[#195], {uri-issue}223[#223])
  * Auto-generated slide IDs with unallowed characters (for revealjs history) now work properly.
    Upstream reveal.js fixed a bug in 3.7.0 (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2037[#2037]) and we removed our broken workaround.
    ({uri-issue}192[#192], {uri-issue}232[#232])

Infrastructure::
  * Travis testing prepared for upcoming Asciidoctor 2.0 ({uri-issue}216[#216])
  * Travis testing for Ruby 2.6 ({uri-issue}243[#243])

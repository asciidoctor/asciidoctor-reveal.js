== Description

[.small%hardbreaks]
_reveal.js_ can automatically animate elements across slides.
Use `[%auto-animate]` on two (or more) adjacent sections:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate]
== Title

This is a paragraph.

[%auto-animate]
== Title

This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
----

[%auto-animate]
== Title

This is a paragraph.

[%auto-animate]
== Title

This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.

[%auto-animate]
== !

Matched element will be animated automatically!

[%auto-animate]
== !

[.highlight]
Matched element will be animated automatically!

And move to the right position!

== Source Blocks

reveal.js supports animation between code blocks.
To enable this feature, all source blocks must have the same `data-id` value.

IMPORTANT: This feature is only supported when using Highlight.js as syntax highlighter and when the option `%linenums` is present.

== Source Blocks

Here's a simple example:

[source.stretch%linenums,asciidoc]
-----
[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=hello]
----
console.log('Hello')
----

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=hello]
----
console.log('Hello')
console.log('Bonjour')
----
-----

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=hello]
----
console.log('Hello')
----

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=hello]
----
console.log('Hello')
console.log('Bonjour')
----

== Source Blocks

And here's a more complex example...

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=planets]
----
let planets = [
  { name: 'mars', diameter: 6779 },
]
----

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=planets]
----
let planets = [
  { name: 'mars', diameter: 6779 },
  { name: 'earth', diameter: 12742 },
  { name: 'jupiter', diameter: 139820 }
]
----

[%auto-animate]
== !

[source%linenums,js,data-id=planets]
----
let circumferenceReducer = ( c, planet ) => {
  return c + planet.diameter * Math.PI;
}

let planets = [
  { name: 'mars', diameter: 6779 },
  { name: 'earth', diameter: 12742 },
  { name: 'jupiter', diameter: 139820 }
]

let c = planets.reduce( circumferenceReducer, 0 )
----

[%auto-animate]
== Easing

[%hardbreaks.small]
The attribute `auto-animate-easing` is used to control the speed of the transition.
You can use any value supported by https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function[transition-timing-function].

For instance:
[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out
----

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

Pong! 🏓

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

Pong! 🏓

🏓 Ping?

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"]
== Easing In Out

🏓 Ping?

Pong! 🏓

== Unmatched

[.small]
Determines whether elements with no matching `auto-animate` target should fade in.
Set to `false` to make them appear instantly.

For instance:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate,auto-animate-unmatched=false]
== Unmatched

Introduction. (matched)

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-unmatched=false]
== Unmatched

Introduction. (matched)

This will be shown instantly ⚡ (unmatched)
----

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-unmatched=false]
== Unmatched

Introduction. (matched)

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-unmatched=false]
== Unmatched

Introduction. (matched)

This will be shown instantly ⚡ (unmatched)

== Duration

Animation duration in seconds.

For instance:
[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate,auto-animate-duration=5]
== Duration
----

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-duration=5]
== Duration

This animation...

[%auto-animate,auto-animate-duration=5]
== Duration

This animation...

...will take 5 seconds! ⌚

[%auto-animate]
== Delay

[.small]
Animation delay in seconds (can only be set for specific elements, not at the slide level)

For instance:
[source,asciidoc]
----
[%auto-animate]
== Lift Off

Final countdown...

[%auto-animate]
== Lift Off

Final countdown...

[data-auto-animate-delay=1]
3,
[data-auto-animate-delay=2]
2,
[data-auto-animate-delay=3]
1...
[data-auto-animate-delay=4]
Lift off! 🚀
----

[%auto-animate]
== Lift Off

Final countdown...

[%auto-animate]
== Lift Off

Final countdown...

[data-auto-animate-delay=1]
3,
[data-auto-animate-delay=2]
2,
[data-auto-animate-delay=3]
1...
[data-auto-animate-delay=4]
Lift off! 🚀

== Id and Restart

When you want separate groups of auto-animated slides right next to each other you can use the `auto-animate-id` and `auto-animate-restart` attributes.

== Id and Restart

Two adjacent slides will only auto-animate if they have the same id or if both don't have one.

== Id and Restart

`auto-animate-restart` will prevent auto-animate between the previous slide even if they have the same id but _not_ between it and the next slide.
